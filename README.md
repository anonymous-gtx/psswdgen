Password Generation in python
This Project is made by with an experiment regarding some password creation which method almost
every website and application asks.

This python script uses random module for generating random letters, symbols and numbers which were
in the form of lists. I also used an range function too because the script asks user to enter "How 
many letters you want?", "How many numbers you want?", and "How many symbols you want?".
